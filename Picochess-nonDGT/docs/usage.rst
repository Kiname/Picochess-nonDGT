Usage
=====

Setup the starting position
---------------------------
Place the pieces in starting position. It doesn't matter if you have the white or black pieces in front of you. Both ways will work. Keep in mind that with black pieces in front of you the (printed) coordinates of your dgt-board also reversed.
You can now start a game by moving a piece or press the middle button to let picochess start.

Also you can change the default settings of 5mins blitz against stockfish in strongest level by placing the white&black extra queen on the appropriate square or use the clock buttons (for detailed infomation see below).
Please keep in mind that placing the extra queens only working if you are in the starting position whereas the clock buttons always working regardless the chess position.

Playing/Training Modes
----------------------

When using these modes, please be patient and don't rush moves. Allow a few seconds for the scores and moves to appear. If you see any bug when rushing moves, let us know on the mailing list.

* Game mode is enabled by putting the **white** queen on the **A5** square. This is the default mode. You can play against the computer. The clock displays the remaining thinking time for both sides. Press the second button to show the position evaluation, expressed in centipawns. Press again to show a hint ("ponder move").
* Analysis mode (enabled by **white** queen on **B5**): the computer is watching the game, it does not play itself. The clock continually displays the best move for the side to play.
* Kibitz mode (enabled by **white** queen on **C5**): the computer is watching the game, it does not play itself. The clock continually displays the position score.
* Observe mode (enabled by **white** queen on **D5**): the computer is watching the game, it does not play itself. The clock displays the remaining thinking time for both sides. Press the second button once to show the position evaluation, twice to show a hint.
* Remote play mode (enabled by **white** queen on **E5**): this modus is right now not implemented (future use). It will allow you to play against someone over internet.

Game mode is the regular mode. If you used one of the other modes, you can return back to game mode by putting the extra **white** queen on **A5**.
You can also press the fourth button for toggling over the modes (Qa5-Qe5 only working in the starting position).

The position score will always be displayed in centipawns from White's perspective. For example when the clock displays 33, then White is ahead 33 centipawns (or 0.33 pawns). A negative score means black is ahead.

Choosing skill level
--------------------
Put the extra **black** queen on your DGT board to select skill level. Putting it on square A6 will select level 0 (easiest), while B6 selects level 1, C6 selects level 2, etc. If no skill level is selected, PicoChess uses level 20 (the highest level) by default. Level 20 can also be selected by placing the extra black queen on square E4.
(Remove the extra white queen if it is still on the board). Please notice that not all chess engines support levels.

* Level  0 estimates about 1100 Elo (Absolute beginner)
* Level 10 estimates about 1750 Elo (Mediate club player )
* Level 20 estimates about 2570 Elo (Advanced tournament player)

Another way to choose the skill level is by entering the "Level" menu with the clock buttons. Detailed explanation is below.

It should be noted that not all engines work at the same speed. If you switch engines whilst in 'Analyze' or 'Kibitz' training modes

Clock buttons (in Book menu)
----------------------------

* First button shows the current selected book name

* Fourth button goes up in the book list

It is possible to select any additional books you may have installed from the clock buttons, but the selection from the board is fixed.
Books must be in the Polyglot (.bin) format and must be named <letter><"-"><book name>, eg "a-nobook.bin" or "m-benoni.bin". Books appear in alphabetical order in the menu. 
Books "a" to "j" are used for setting from the board and contain the existing system books; they can be changed to make others available from the board.

Clock Buttons (in System menu)
------------------------------

* First button shows the picochess version
* Second button shows the last two parts of your IP-address
* Third button shutdown the machine. You have to press twice to activate this shutdown (for your safety). Pressing another button cancels it
* Fourth button reboots the machine. You have to press twice to activate this reboot (for your safety). Pressing another button cancels it

System shutdown
---------------

From the start position, replace the white king with the extra white queen; this will shut down the machine (takes a few seconds until the blue light turns off). You can also do it with only the two white queens on the board (on e1,d1).

PGN file support
----------------

All moves of the played game along with engine are stored at the end of the game.
Every game played with picochess is stored in the /opt/picochess folder as "games.pgn".
If you want to end it before and write out the pgn file including the correct result, you can do as following:
Placing the two kings on opposite centre squares will signal a resignation:
    - If both kings on white, the result is white wins and the game recorded 1-0
    - If both kings on black, the result is black wins and the game recorded 0-1

Placing the kings on adjacent centre squares on the same rank signals a draw and the game recorded 1/2-1/2.
The 4 and 5 rank must be clear of other pieces - only kings.
